# fast-currency-converter-nbp
Example of currency converter based on NBP currencies rates, coded in JS.

**What I used?:**
* JS 
* HTML5
* CSS3 
* Font Awesome Icons

**Why I created it?**

I wanted to create currency converter to allow the user to check two currencies conversion rate based on NBP daily updates.  

**Why it is usefull?**
1. I am featching the currency NBP rates from API endpoint as JSON file. (on aplication load)
2. You can calculate two currencies conversion rate, just by putting value to the input and selecting the destination currency code.
3. The recalculation is made on every input value change and also on destination currency code change.
4. The calculation is working in two directions from PLN to other currency and vice versa.
